# Colloidal_Crystal_Order_Determination 

#The code for this project was developed for the academic paper "Autonomous Annealing of Colloidal Crystals Induced by 
#Light-Powered Oscillations of Active Particles". It creates a automated process for analyzing the number of neighbors 
#in each frame taken ( a text document with coordinates).
