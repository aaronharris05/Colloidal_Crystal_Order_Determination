# Colloidal_Crystal_Order_Determination 

The code for this project was developed for the academic paper "Autonomous Annealing of Colloidal Crystals Induced by Light-Powered Oscillations of Active Particles". It creates an automated process for analyzing the number of neighbors per particle in each frame of a video. The input is a .txt or .csv file (or a folder of these files) containing XY coordinates for each particle in an image. From this, we determine the distance between all particles and find each particle's "neighbor count". Neighbors are defined as particles within a specified distance from the given particle, and for a close-packed system, the optimal neighbor count is 6.
